    "- **Input Files**: Place your PDF/EPUB files in the same directory as the notebook, or provide relative/absolute paths.\n",
    "- **Device Selection**: The notebook will automatically detect Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3/M4) and use MLX for optimal performance. On other platforms, it will fall back to CPU mode.\n",
    "- **Voice Cloning**: F5-TTS-MLX supports zero-shot voice cloning. Provide a reference audio file (mono, 24kHz, 5-10s WAV) and its transcription to clone a voice.\n",
    "  - To convert audio to the required format: `ffmpeg -i input.wav -ac 1 -ar 24000 -sample_fmt s16 -t 10 output.wav`\n",
    "- **PDF Extraction**: The notebook uses `unstructured.io` for advanced PDF extraction with layout analysis. This may take longer but provides better results.\n",
    "- **Manifest Files**: Each audio output includes a JSON manifest file with sentence-level timing information and metadata.\n",
    "- **Performance**: On Apple Silicon (M4 MacBook Air), generation typically takes ~4 seconds per sentence. Performance scales with the number of CPU cores.\n",
    "- **Error Handling**: The notebook includes CPU fallback for errors. If synthesis fails on a particular sentence, it will insert silence and continue."
